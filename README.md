## Sandwich Club Project

Created as a part of [Udacity's Android Developer Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801).

Lessons learned:
1. Design and build a layout for a detail activity.
2. Write the JSON parsing to populate its fields from data received.

As an extra a CollapsingToolbarLayout was used to implement a [collapsing app bar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=11u99_uuxXm9nJ-Sc3t2nnG35abA0P9yw).

The Sandwich Club app starter code can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/sandwich-club-starter-code).
